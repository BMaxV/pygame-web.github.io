Welcome to the pygbag packages (actually wheel format) repository list.

README.md should be in  /wiki/pkg/`<import name>`/README.md , not the pypi project name.
  
It should have a short example whenever possible and covers those points :  
- the case when a loop must be async-ified)
- files have been modified, explain why
- files added which are they for ?
- files removed ( size / irrrelevant )
- missing/extra functionnalitites list details
- what it brings that pygame cannot do, or cannot do in an easy way.
